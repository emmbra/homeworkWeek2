# CSS and Bootstrap Responsive Portfolio

[CSS and Bootstrap Responsive Portfolio](https://emmbra.github.io/homeworkWeek2/index.html)

## Description

Created a mobile responsive portfolio website with three pages: About, Portfolio, and Contact.

## Technologies

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Bootstrap CDN

## Challenges

In total this project took about 10 hours to build. 

Difficulties included:

* How do I make a sticky footer actually stick?
* How do I make the images mobile responsive?
* How do I add more interactivity?

What a I learned along the way is that I don't know what I don't know! Through extensive google-fu I was able to  deal with my first two challenges through trial and error, but I figured out that many of the ideas I had for improving the website require more JavaScript knowledge than I currently have. I look forward to coming back and revamping this project with more interactivity once I have a better grasp of JavaScript.
